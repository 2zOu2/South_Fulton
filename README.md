## Overview
### Community Need: 
The community, represented by the Southeast Environmental Justice Alliance (SEJA), faces multifaceted needs spanning various domains. Primarily, there's a pressing need for a healthier and more sustainable local environment. Their goal is to identify environmental problems, ranging from air pollution to water quality, conservation, and toxic waste, and using scientific data and expert input to present solutions. According to their website, their concerns include 
the proliferation of fast-food restaurants, littering exacerbated by the prevalence of 18-wheelers, and a desire for increased green spaces to mitigate urban challenges. 

Additionally, SEJA grapples with safety issues such as speeding and worries about the welfare of local wildlife. Environmentally, they work hard to reduce the emissions from diesel trucks, the pollution of storm drains and creeks due to littering, and the unpleasant odor in the air. Furthermore, their concerns were directed towards facilities like XPO Logistics-JLG, Linde Gas, LLC, B&B Construction Processing, and Clean Earth, suggesting a need for enhanced oversight and mitigation measures to address the environmental impact of their operations. Overall, the community's needs revolve around fostering a healthier, safer, and more sustainable living environment for all residents.

These facilities locations serve as point-source polluters, contributing to environmental degradation that impacts air, water, and soil quality in the surrounding areas. Specifically, diesel trucks' emissions exacerbate air pollution, leading to a foul odor permeating the air. This pollution raises concerns about the contaminants present in the air and water, prompting questions about the extent of violations occurring at these facilities. Our team is therefore to help them identify these information regarding pollutants present, their harmful effects, and what actions can be taken to mitigate them. We also need to uncover the transparency regarding the nature of pollutants, identifying severe violations, and implementing measures to rectify them, as the community strives for a healthier and safer environment.

### Solution:
Our team is therefore to help them identify this information regarding pollutants present, their harmful effects, and what actions can be taken to mitigate them. We also need to uncover the transparency regarding the nature of pollutants, identifying severe violations, and implementing measures to rectify them, as the community strives for a healthier and safer environment.

### So What & Benefit:
This research process will help us better understand and inform the community with correct information on the pollution plants and locations. These point-source polluters not only degrade air, water, and soil quality but also pose risks to public health and well-being, such as respiratory issues and mental issues. Without information and action, the community remains vulnerable to the harmful effects of pollution. Recognizing these issues and implementing solutions is therefore critical to the well-being and sustainable development of communities. 

### Smart Goal:
#### Specific 
Our goal is to identify specific industrial plants contributing to water and air pollution in targeted areas within the community represented by the Southeast Environmental Justice Alliance (SEJA).
#### Measurable
We will conduct thorough assessments using scientific methods and data analysis to pinpoint the sources of pollution in the designated areas. This will involve quantifying pollutant levels in water bodies and air samples and correlating them with potential industrial sources.
#### Achievable
Leveraging partnerships with environmental agencies, local authorities, and community stakeholders, we will gather necessary data and conduct site investigations to accurately identify pollution sources. We will ensure that our resources and expertise align with the scope of the project. Also rely on tools such as GIS to make it appealing and easily understandable for audience.
#### Relevant
Identifying pollution sources is crucial for addressing the community's mission of fostering a healthier and safer environment. By pinpointing specific industrial plants contributing to pollution, we can support SEJA's efforts to advocate for environmental justice and implement targeted mitigation measures.
#### Time-bound 
Within the next 2 months, we will complete comprehensive assessments in targeted areas to identify specific industrial plants responsible for water and air pollution. Progress will be monitored weekly, with a final report and recommendations provided to SEJA by the end of the timeline.
#### Questions:
1. What are the specific geographic locations, types of plants, pollutants that is affecting the South Fulton area over time? Which location has the most pollutants so that we can pay extra attention to and inform the community? 
2. What do we know from the water quality data? And is there any correlation between water quality, air, and pollution factors over the years?

## Plan
Our project focuses on investigating air and water pollution in South Fulton. Here is our [Project Plan](https://github.com/2zOu2/North_Fulton/blob/main/Project%20Plan.xlsx)
## Data sources
### Dataset discription
The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is an information resource available through the Environmental Protection Agency that can help you learn about the management and release of toxic chemicals in your community. The TRI Program was established in 1987 out of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. Today, there are over 21,000 facilities that report data to TRI nationwide, and it covers over 800 toxic chemicals. 

We mainly use the TRI [Dataset](https://github.com/2zOu2/South_Fulton/blob/main/South%20Fulton%20TRI%20data%202020-2022.csv) around South Fulton. It is directly downloaded from the TRI website.
### Map Demo
We aim to create a interactive map to tell the datastory, and we have a [Chemical Pollution Map](https://github.com/2zOu2/South_Fulton/blob/main/pollution_map.html) and 
[Water Pollution Map](https://github.com/2zOu2/South_Fulton/blob/main/monitoring_site_map.html)
